# ü¶à School of Sharks Workout Library System ‚ö°

A comprehensive database schema for managing structured cycling training workouts, designed for coaches to create detailed training plans and assign them to athletes with precision control over every aspect of the training session.

## üéØ Overview

The Workout Library System enables:
- **Coaches** to create detailed, structured workouts with multiple segments

- Athlete feedback integration

#### `workout_execution_results`
Actual performance data when athletes complete workouts.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive performance metrics
- Segment-by-segment results (JSONB)
- Training Stress Score (TSS) calculation
- Athlete rating system (difficulty, enjoyment)
- Integration with cycling sessions

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Creating a Threshold Workout

```sql
-- Create the main workout
INSERT INTO workout_library (
    name, description, training_type, 
    primary_control_parameter, estimated_duration_minutes, 
    difficulty_level, tags
) VALUES (
    'Threshold Development - 3x7min',
    'Classic threshold workout to build lactate buffering capacity',
    'threshold', 'hr', 60, 7,
    ARRAY['threshold', 'ftp', 'structured']
);

-- Add workout segments
INSERT INTO workout_segments (
    workout_library_id, segment_order, segment_type,
    name, duration_minutes, hr_min_percent, hr_max_percent,
    repetitions, instructions
) VALUES 
    (1, 1, 'warmup', 'Warm Up', 10, 65, 75, 1, 'Gradual warm-up preparation'),
    (1, 2, 'main', '3x 7min Threshold', 7, 82, 89, 3, 'Steady threshold effort'),
    (1, 3, 'cooldown', 'Cool Down', 10, 50, 65, 1, 'Easy recovery spinning');
```

### Assigning a Workout

```sql
-- Coach assigns workout to athlete
INSERT INTO workout_assignments (
    workout_library_id, assigned_to_user_id, assigned_by_user_id,
    scheduled_date, intensity_adjustment, custom_notes
) VALUES (
    1, 123, 456, '2025-07-26', 0.95, 
    'First threshold session - focus on pacing'
);
```

### Recording Results

```sql
-- Athlete completes workout
INSERT INTO workout_execution_results (
    workout_assignment_id, actual_duration_minutes,
    perceived_exertion, avg_heart_rate, avg_power,
    difficulty_rating, enjoyment_rating, athlete_notes
) VALUES (
    1, 58, 7, 165, 250, 8, 7, 
    'Felt strong in the intervals, good session!'
);
```

## üìà Advanced Queries

### Find Popular Workouts
```sql
SELECT 
    wl.name,
    COUNT(wa.id) as assignments,
    AVG(wer.enjoyment_rating) as avg_rating
FROM workout_library wl
LEFT JOIN workout_assignments wa ON wl.id = wa.workout_library_id
LEFT JOIN workout_execution_results wer ON wa.id = wer.workout_assignment_id
GROUP BY wl.id, wl.name
